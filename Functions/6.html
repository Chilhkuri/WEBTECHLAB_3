<!-- Ramesh, a school student, was bored at home in the pandemic. He wanted to play
but there was no one to play with. He was doing some mathematics questions
including prime numbers and thought of creating a game using the same. After a
few days of work, he was ready with his game. He wants to play the game with you.
GAME:
Ramesh will randomly provide you a range [ L , R ] (both inclusive) and you have to
tell him the maximum difference between the prime numbers in the given range.
There are three answers possible for the given range.
1.
There are two distinct prime numbers in the given range so the maximum
difference can be found.
2.
There is only one distinct prime number in the given range. The maximum
difference in this case would be 0.
3.
There are no prime numbers in the given range. The output for this case would
be -1.
To win the game, the participant should answer the prime difference correctly for the
given range.
Example:
Range: [ 1, 10 ]
The maximum difference between the prime numbers in the given range is 5.
Difference = 7 - 2 = 5
Range: [ 5, 5 ]
There is only one distinct prime number so the maximum difference would be 0.
Range: [ 8 , 10 ]
There is no prime number in the given range so the output for the given range would
be -1.
Can you win the game? -->
